# nightbot-functions

### What are they?
<details>
  <summary>
    tl;dr: an ever expanding set of functions you can add to nightbot
  </summary>
  <br />

  ### Commands

  | Command | Arguments | Description |
  | :---------------: | :--------------- | :--------------- |
  | !dbd-rnjesus |  | Randomly selects a killer from dead by daylight to play as |
  | !pick-random | ...choices | selects 1 from an unbounded number of following args |

  ### What else
  It also is a really svelte environment to write the functions with pretty var names and so on, and then collapse them to single-liners

### How to use them?
<details>
  <summary>
    tl;dr: <TODO><code>`control + c && control + v`</code>
  </summary>
  <br />

  [go here to see minified functions for copying](src/compiled.md)

  Alternatively, you may find it beneficial to write new functions! that's super easy too!

  Just clone this repo! Then `npm i`. Then create a new function inside `src`!

  `###` is replaced with your minified code

  then run `npm run minify`

</details>
<br/>

### TODO:
- Keep adding functions!
- Maybe even support typescript!?
